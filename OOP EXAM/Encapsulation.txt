Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that act on that data into a single unit called an object. 
This mechanism keeps the data safe from outside interference and misuse.

In the context of a physical library, consider a Book class. 
The data (or attributes) of the Book class could be title, author, ISBN, and isBorrowed. 
The methods could be borrowBook(), returnBook(), getTitle(), getAuthor(), etc.
